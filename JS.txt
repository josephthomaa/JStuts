Variables
	Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed by any name you want to call it
	eg: var myVariable = 'Bob';
	Basically, anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable.
	var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
	
	//changing color of myVariable
	myVariable.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
	var myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
	
	Note: JavaScript is case sensitive â€” myVariable is a different variable to myvariable. If you are getting problems in your code, check the casing!
	
Events:
	These are code structures which listen for things happening in browser, running code in response. The most obvious example is the click event
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
	eg:document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
    alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');
	}	
Operators
	Equality: 	Does a test to see if two values are equal to one another and returns a true/false (Boolean) result.(===)
	Not, Does-not-equal : !, !==

Document.querySelector()
	The Document method querySelector() returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.
	eg: var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
	Selectors can also be really powerful, as demonstrated in the following example. Here, the first <input> element with the name "login" (<input name="login"/>) located inside a <div> whose class is "user-panel main" (<div class="user-panel main">) in the document is returned:
	var el = document.querySelector("div.user-panel.main input[name='login']");
